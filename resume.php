          After a couple weeks into an introductory Computer Science class, I was hooked on programming and knew this was my future.
          The computer science program exposed me to various CS concepts from computer security to mobile app development.  I also attended numerous campus
          Hackathons (Startup Weekend 2012, MHACKS II - V).

            In a company wide competition, Ford released consumer connected vehicle data for employees to implement a use case with the data, similar to a Hackathon.
          Our team developed a proof of concept website that details vehicle performance such as fuel economy, idle engine speed, and engine temperature.  Furthermore,
          we were able to compare a customer's vehicle performance against other drivers on similar routes.  Our team placed first and were priveleged to present our
          work to Ford CEO Mark Fields.

            In the height of the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), our team joked that SOPA could be misread as "soap".
          This lead to the idea of developing a website where SOPA protesters could send soap to congressmen supporting the bill.  We were selected as a finalist during
          Startup Weekend Ann Arbor and were given a weekend to develop a prototype.  Unfortunately, the SOPA bill was dissolved the same weekend but we were still able
          to pitch our prototype to a panel of start up experts and investors.
